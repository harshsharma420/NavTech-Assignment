Hello , 
This is the Navtech Test Coding Assignment.



Note:
1. I got initially stuck at a very basic problem, I didnt use {} in the formGroup declaration but towards the end I was able to fix it.
2. As I got stuck up on the formgroup initialization I was unable to make the UI pretty.
3. However I did complete the tasks at the end and the form works and the list also works.
4. As angular is a client side application it did send the post request through httpclient but the json file just being a static file it doesnt change, client side application would be required for that.
Hopefully, it suits the needs.
Thank you for the oppurtunity.
And looking forward to hearing Back.
